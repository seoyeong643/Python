# Hangman

This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic word-guessing game. You'll have to guess the word letter by letter, and be careful not to make too many mistakes, or you might get "hung"!

## Project Structure
The project consists of two main Python files:

- `hangman.py`: The main game logic, where you can play the Hangman game.
- `hangman_figure.py`: A module that provides ASCII art for the hangman figure as it progresses.
